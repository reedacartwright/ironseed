## Overview

Ironseed is an R package that improves seeding for R's built in random number
generators. An ironseed is a finite-entropy (or fixed-entropy) hash that can be
used to generate an unlimited sequence of seeds for initializing the state of a
random number generator. It is inspired by the work of M.E. O'Neill and others
\[[1](https://www.pcg-random.org/posts/simple-portable-cpp-seed-entropy.html),
[2](https://gist.github.com/imneme/540829265469e673d045)\].

An ironseed is a 256-bit hash constructed from a variable-length sequence of
32-bit inputs. Each ironseed consists of eight 32-bit sub-hashes. The sub-hashes
are 32-bit multilinear hashes \[[3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.4961.pdf)\]
that accumulate entropy from the input sequence. Each input is included in every
sub-hash. The coefficients for the multilinear hashes are generated by a Weyl
sequence.

Multilinear hashes are also used to generate a seed sequence from an ironseed.
Each 32-bit output value is generated by uniquely hashing the sub-hashes. The
coefficients for the output are also generated by a second Weyl sequence.

## Installation

You can install the development version of Ironseed from Github:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("reedacartwright/ironseed")
```

## Example

Ironseed can be used at the top of a script to robustly initialize R's builtin
random number generator.

``` r
#!/usr/bin/env -S Rscript --vanilla
ironseed::ironseed("Experiment", 20251031, 1)
print(runif(100))
```
